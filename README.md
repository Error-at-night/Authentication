# Authentication using MERN Stack, JWT, TailwindCSS, Typescript, Redux React-Query, Axios, and React-Hook-Form

Some few months ago I completed a Backend Development Course, so I built an authentication system to practice everything I
have learn, I am also looking forward to writing more Backend code (like building APIs and so) and diving deep into Backend
Development. I have actually started reading some documentations that will really help me

## Overview

### The challenge

- Users are able to sign up using their Fullname, email and password
- After signing up, the user will recieve a verification code in their email to use to verify their email
- If the user does not verify their email before the verification code expires, the user can request for a new verification code
- If the user tries to use an invalid verification code or expired verification code, the user will see a toast message telling the user that the verification code has expired or it is invalid
- If the user tries to login without verifying their email, the user will see a toast message telling the user to verify their email
- Users can only see the dashboard page only if they are authenticated
- Only authenticated users can logout
- Users are also able to reset their password
